======= Hi =======

Hello members, thanks for picking up a copy of this software.

I would first like to make it clear that you must read "LICENSE" to continue,
and to please not use this software maliciously.

Now that, that is over i can explain what this source code and binary does,
it is a configurable injector with parameters set in the XML files to control its actions.

You can attach your module to any process name you wish, with two very different methods.

Method "FILE":
Classic remote-code allocation stub to call LoadLibraryW. . .simple and effective,
works confirmed on Windows XP+ (Vista, 7 compatible)

Method "MEMORY:"
"Manual mapping" they call it, but this is a cleaned up version of any previous code,
this manually maps your file by reading it, then mapping the buffer into the executable's memory space,
after which it manually fixes relocations, imports, etc, and nearly nothing can stop you,
a special warning however, this module has a chance of being injected multiple times if not controlled.

This is like DLL injection with PEB/LDR and NtQueryVirtualMemory hiding all in one.

I would also like to mention this new* code was based off of "Darwak"'s previous works.

( * = Version 1 of "CNTLoader" )

======= Explaination of configuration file (XML) =======

<mod>: This is the module you want to inject, must be in the same path as the executable and xml.
<exe>: This is the executable you want to inject into [OPTIONAL]
<win>: This is the window name you want to inject into [OPTIONAL]
<cls>: This is the class name you want to inject into [OPTIONAL]
<inj>: This is the injection method you want, "MEMORY" or "FILE", otherwise defaulted to "FILE"
<motd>: Add new "Messages of the day" by adding a line with data, the format is as follows:

<m>Here is a MOTD!</m>

======= Bye and shout =======
Thanks!
